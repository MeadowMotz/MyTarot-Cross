card manipulation using cv2 lib
  find edges of card using Canny
  detect quadrilateral using Douglas-Peucker Approximation
  calculate homography matrix
  apply homography

manipulation interactivity after auto-detect
  place points at endpoints of auto-detect
  place points at midpoints of edges
  make points click- & drag-able
  edges and points move when a point moves (overlay over image)
  calculate homography from current point positions
  allow edit of text (text editor)

text recognition
  use model from class
  train with alphanumeric dataset
  train with cursive dataset
  test with data from both
  host locally
